# EnyaFHE

EnyaFHE provides an API and SDK for using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** in your app. With FHE, you can privately compute on sensitive data. This means that, depending on how you set things up, only the data source (e.g. the consumer) can see the results of the computation. Use cases include secure surveys and financial products.

# Demo

Our sample app demonstrates the core features of the SDK. Please visit [**EnyaExpo**](https://github.com/enyalabs/EnyaExpo) to learn more.
